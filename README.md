# METRO Markets Challenge for Frontend Engineer

## Skills required:
 * Javascript
 * Typescript
 * CSS
 * rx.js

Project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation on Angular's Mat-Table. 

### *Important*  
We do not require you to know Angular. 

Solution of tasks in that codebase does not require knowledge of how Angular works.

And when it does (in task 4) it gives a hint what to use.

Our intention with that task is to see how you can dive into codebase, identify problems and solve them.

## Challenges
 - Run yarn install
 - Search for FIND_ME in project and find 7 challenges to solve.
